Steps to follow:
Step 1: Set Up Your Project Files
1. Create a New Folder for your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Inside this folder, create:
o index.php: This will contain your PHP and HTML code.
o visitor_count.txt: An empty file where the visitor count will be stored.
o phpStyle.css (optional): Any CSS you want to style your page.
Step 2: Save Your PHP and HTML Code in index.php
Step 3: Run the PHP File with a Local Server
1. Open the Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code by selecting View > Terminal.
2. Start PHPâ€™s Built-In Server by navigating to the folder where index.php is saved and
running:
php -S localhost:8000
3. Access the Page in Your Browser: Open a browser and go to
http://localhost:8000/index.php.
4. Check the Visitor Counter:Each time you refresh the page, the visitor count should
increase, as the PHP code increments the count and saves it in visitor_count.txt.
